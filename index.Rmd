```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
source("analysis.R")
```

This data comes from [this repo](https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper) and shows the candidate leads over time. Interestingly, Biden took the lead in Georgia at `r ga_lead_time`.

Here is the number of time stamps for each state in the data set:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(timestamps_by_state,
             col.names = c("State", "Number of Time Stamps"), "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

Here is what the result looked like at the end of the vote tallies:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}
vote_diff_plot
vote_pct_plot
```
